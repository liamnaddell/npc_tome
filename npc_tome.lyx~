What is NP?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NP is a class of languages that have polynomial time verifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Verifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A verifier for a language A is an algorithm V where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $A=\left\{ w|\text{ V accepts \left\langle w,c\right\rangle for some string c }\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time it takes to run a verifier is measured in terms of the length of
 w.
 In this system, c is the certificate

\begin_layout Subsection
The Big Cheng 5: Proving a problem in NP the right way!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Show that Q is a decision problem.
 This is usually quite obvious from the way Q’s question is asked, so merely
 stating that Q is a decision problem will often be sufficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Describe what a certificate would be for a Yes instance of Q.
 Most of the time this is also quite obvious from the way Q’s question is
 asked.
 If the question asks, “is there a blah?”, (i.e., it essentially asks for
 the existence of something), then usually the certificate is simply the
 blah (the thing about whose existence is asked by the question).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Explain why the certificate is polysize with respect to the input size.
 Frequently the certificate is no larger than the input.
 In such cases the certificate size is at most linear with respect to the
 input size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Describe what a verification algorthm would do.
 The certificate is commonly something that satisfies some set of criteria.
 So the algorithm needs to check (or verify) that these criteria are satisfied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Explain why the verification algorithm runs in polytime.
 Typically we would only need to give running times for the checks that
 the algorithm performs

 is the only way to do it, and there are no other ways.

NP-COMPLETENESS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NP-Complete problems are problems that are both in NP and NP-hard.
 An NP-Hard problem is a problem that is at least as hard as all other NP-hard
 problems.
 Putting these toegether, if one NP-complete problem has a polytime solver,
 they all do.
 But, if one NP-complete problem can be shown to have no polytime solver,
 none of them do
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The grandfather of NP-Complete problems: SAT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\text{SAT}=\left\{ \left\langle \phi\right\rangle \vert\phi\text{ is a satisfiable boolean formula}\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A satisfiable boolean formula is a boolean formula such that some assignment
 of variables makes the formula output true.
 Truth assignments are often labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, and assigning the variables in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 with the assignments in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\left(\phi\right)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This proof looks too big to put here

\begin_layout Section
Polytime reductions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Language A is polytime reducible to language B, 
\begin_inset Formula $A\leq_{p}B$
\end_inset

 if a TOTAL, POLYTIME, and COMPUTABLE function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\Sigma^{\star}\to\Sigma^{\star}$
\end_inset

 exists with the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in A\iff f(w)\in B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So to reduce A to B, create a function which maps yes instances of A to
 yes instances of B, and no instances of A to no instances of B, this is
 the contrapositive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How do polytime reductions relate to time complexity?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $A\leq_{p}B$
\end_inset

, or A polytime reduces to B, and B is in P, then, here's a polytime solver
 for A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
solveA
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle w\right\rangle :$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Formula $w_{b}=f(w)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
return solveB
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w_{b}\right)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since f is a polytime computable total function that maps yes instances
 of A to yes instances of B, and solveB is polytime, if solveB accepts,
 then w must be in A, and if solveB rejects, w must NOT be in A.
 Additionally, since B and f are polytime computable, solveA must be polytime
 computable.
 This is the core of polytime computability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Polytime reductions and it's incomprehensible notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\leq_{p}$
\end_inset

 is one of the most confusing and poorly implemented operators I have ever
 seen.
 Typically, symbols notate a relation between two objects.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

justification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq_{p}$
\end_inset

 is that if 
\begin_inset Formula $A\leq_{p}B$
\end_inset

, A is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Less than or equal to B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in terms of hardness.
 This is complete gibberish.
 This is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which communicates the thing one can prove using the existence of a relation
 between two objects.
 Imagine if we wrote all notation this way! There would be COMPLETE ANARCHY!!!!
 Not only that, but this convention encourages un-mathematical, un-creative,
 instrumentalist applications of mathematical reasoning.
 This is wholly unfit for a theoretical course.
 This is unlike all other notation, and the person who invented it should
 be candidate #2 for NASA's man-on-the-sun space mission right after Elon
 Musk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
How to remember this difficult notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rule 1: read right to left: if 
\begin_inset Formula $A\leq_{p}B$
\end_inset

, then a polytime reduction FROM A, TO B exists, I.e.
 inputs in A, go TO, B.
 The english phraseology gets this exactly correct.
 A polytime reduction goes from A to B, and the inputs of A, go TO B.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Polytime reduction definition of NP-complete
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using our new approach, we can define NP-completeness to be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A language B is NP-complete if it satisfies two conditions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 B is in NP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 if A
\begin_inset Formula $\in$
\end_inset

NP, then 
\begin_inset Formula $A\leq_{p}B$
\end_inset

 for any A in NP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This works because if B has a polytime solver, then A must have a polytime
 solver.
 This means that B's solvability in polynomial time makes a claim about
 every single NP-complete problem's solvability in polytime, which is the
 point of the NP-complete class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The first reduction: SAT

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\text{3SAT}=\left\{ \phi\vert\phi\text{ is a 3-cnf formula which is satisfiable}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
A 3-cnf formula, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conjunctive normal form formula with 3 variables in each clause
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is composed of clauses as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x\vee y\vee\neg x\right)\wedge\left(z\vee p\vee\neg x\right)\wedge\cdots$
\end_inset

.
 Notably, these formulas have no constants.
 An easy way to remember is that cnf formulas are

WTS: 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{SAT\ensuremath{\leq_{p}}3SAT}$
\end_inset

.
 Showing SAT Polytime reduces to 3SAT will show that if 3SAT is in P, then
 SAT is in P.
 This proves that 3SAT is NP-complete
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of this reduction are not super important, since finding an
 algorithm to take any formula composed of literals, ands, or's and nots
 and transforming it into a 3-cnf formula is very boring and not required
 knowledge.
 But an appropriate algorithm would have the following passes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Transform literals into tautologies, 
\begin_inset Formula $\neg x\vee x=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\neg x\wedge x=0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Use de morgan's law to make all nots go directly in front of variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 probably many others
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intuitively, such an algorithm makes sense since we are used to transforming
 logical statements into other equivalent statements, since this was tested
 in a67 and many other courses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the principle of arm waiving, we now have a function

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\in\text{SAT}$

\begin_layout Standard
If

 This means at least one variable in each triplet evaluates to true.
 If one puts these three variables (henceforth vertices) into a set, these
 vertices will form a k-clique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for the reverse direction, suppose that G contains a k-clique: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know the elements of this clique must all appear in distinct clauses
 since there are no edges to vertices of the same clause.
 Similarly, we know none of these vertices have edges to contradictory labels
 by the given construction above.
 Now, create a truth assignment 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 with the labels from the vertices inside the k-clique.
 Therefore, this truth assignment must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle G,k\right\rangle \in\text{CLIQUE}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \phi\right\rangle \in\text{3SAT}$

\begin_layout Subsection
What is this?

\begin_layout Standard
What are the gadgets?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core idea is that a clique must contain k vertices who's variables can
 ALL BE TRUE at the same time, AND are of different clauses.
 This is a corollary of satisfiability.
 This is why the two restrictions on edges exist.
 In short, the reasoning is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

If k variables can be true at the same time (SAT), then an edge exists between
 all of them
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if k vertices form a clique (CLIQUE), then they can all be true at the same
 time, and are of different clauses

\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for the justification: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \phi\right\rangle \in\text{3SAT}$
\end_inset

, then, select a satisfiable assignment 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, and put all the variable widgets that are assigned true in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 into our vertex cover.
 Now, take 1 variable that was assigned true from each clause, and put the
 other two variables in its clause into the vertex cover.
 Since our vertex cover has 1 variable per variable widget in the VC, and
 2 clause widget variables per clause in the VC, it must have k vertices
 in the vertex-cover.
 Therefore, a vertex cover of size k exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle G,k\right\rangle \in\text{VERTEX-COVER}$
\end_inset

, then our Vertex Cover VC, must select 1 and only 1 variable per variable
 widget, since if it selected 2, it would have to skimp out on including
 clause variable widgets, which wouldn't form a full vertex cover.
 In addition, the vertex cover must select 2 nodes from each clause, where
 the unselected node is set to true, since if it didn't it would miss the
 edge from a node which was set to false to the variable widget.
 This forms a VC of size k, and the selected variables in the vertex clause
 must form satisfiable truth assignment since one unselected-but-true edge
 must exist in each clause.

The construction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a 3-cnf 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, an input to 3SAT, with l variables, and i clauses.
 Make a table as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{array}{c|cccc|cccc}
 & x_{1} & x_{2} & \cdots & x_{l} & c_{1} & c_{2} & \cdots & c_{i}\\
t_{1} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
f_{1} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
t_{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
f_{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
\vdots & 0 & 0 & \vdots & 0\\
\vdots & 0 & 0 & \vdots & 0\\
t_{l} &  &  &  & 1\\
f_{l} &  &  &  & 1\\
\hline t & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
 &  &  &  & \\
 &  &  &  & \\
\end{array}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are going to make the rows our subset, and the row t will be our sum.
 If row 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 is selected then make variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 true, and if row 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 is selected, make variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 false.
 Since t contains a 1 in each column with a variable, this means that every
 variable can only be assigned true or false.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, modify the table.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}$
\end_inset

 is selected, mark each clause in the row 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}$
\end_inset

 1 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 appears in the clause like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{array}{c|cccc|cccc}

f_{1} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
t_{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 &  & \vdots\\
f_{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
\vdots & 0 & 0 & \vdots & 0\\
\vdots & 0 & 0 & \vdots & 0\\
t_{l} &  &  &  & 1\\
f_{l} &  &  &  & 1\\
\hline t & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
 &  &  &  & \\
 &  &  &  & \\
\end{array}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we have to ensure that at least 1 variable in each clause is marked
 as true.
 The problem is that one clause, two clauses, and three clauses could be
 true.
 The way we control for this is adding two extra rows per clause, which
 both contain a 1, like so: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{array}{c|cccc|cccc}
 & x_{1} & x_{2} & \cdots & x_{l} & c_{1} & c_{2} & \cdots & c_{i}\\

f_{1} & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
t_{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 &  & \vdots\\
f_{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
\vdots & 0 & 0 & \vdots & 0\\
\vdots & 0 & 0 & \vdots & 0\\
t_{l} &  &  &  & 1\\
f_{l} &  &  &  & 1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 1\\
\hline h_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
g_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
h_{2} & 0 & 0 & \vdots & 0 &  & 1\\
g_{2} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 &  & 1\\
h_{3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  &  & \cdots\\
g_{3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  &  & \cdots\\
h_{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  &  &  & 1\\
g_{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  &  &  & 1\\
\hline t & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3\\
 &  &  &  & \\
 &  &  &  & \\
\end{array}$

\end_inset

 This 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know S has some subset which sums to t.
 Using the variable construction, we know this subset must select either
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i\leq l$
\end_inset

, where l is the number of rows (variables) in this section of the construction.
 Let our truth assignment 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 assign true and false accordingly (true if 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 is selected, false if 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}$
\end_inset

 is selected).
 In the second quadrent of the table, the clause section, if there is a
 subset sum which sums to t, then that subset must contain at least a 1
 for each clause.
 By the above construction, this implies 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 sets each clause to true.
 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 is satisfiable, which implies that

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle G,s,t\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is an input to HAMPATH, we must map it to an input 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle G^{\prime},s^{\prime},t^{\prime}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 to DOUBLE-HAMPATH
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way we will do this is with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decision widget
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: Add 3 vertices: 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,s_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Add two edges, one from s to x, one from s to y.
 Next, add an edge from x to y and an edge from y to x.
 Then, add an edge from x and y to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Now, move all inbound and outbound edges that s has to 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 This looks as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
preview true
filename "graphics/double-hampath.tex"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 equal our graph with this new widget, let 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\prime}=s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{\prime}=t$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle G,s,t\right\rangle \in$
\end_inset

 HAMPATH.
 Because of the nature of our decision widget, we can either go up then
 down through it, or down then up(zig then zag or zag then zig?).
 Then, the rest of the path remains the same since the rest of the graph
 remains untouched.
 Since the rest of the graph contains a hampath, this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 contains two hampaths from 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, using the contrapositive, assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle G,s,t\right\rangle \not\in\text{HAMPATH}$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that no hamiltonian path exists from s to t.
 This implies that no hamiltonian path exists from 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{t}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, there is no hamiltonian path from 
\begin_inset Formula $s=s^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 contains no double-hampath from 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
